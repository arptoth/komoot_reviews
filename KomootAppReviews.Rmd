## Data import

 The node.js script scraped the reviews in JSON format. It adjusted manually firts because some key values were not claused by "". Afterthat I imported it by jsonlite library in R.

```{r pressure}
# Data import and cleaning ------------------------------------------------

# Read US App Store reviews about Komoot
reviews <- read_json("reviews.json")

# Translate to tibble
reviews <-  bind_rows(reviews)

reviews
```


## Let' explore the data

What is the average rating in USA?


```{r}
# Average ratings of Komoot App in the US Store based on these 157 reviews
mean(reviews$score)

```


```{r, message=FALSE}
# Distributions of ratings
reviews %>%  ggplot(aes(score)) + geom_bar() + theme_minimal()

# Number of reviews grouped by version
version_counts <- reviews %>% select(version) %>% group_by(version) %>% summarise(Count=n()) %>% arrange(desc(Count))
version_counts
```
