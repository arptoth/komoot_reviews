    "title": "Great Combo with Elemnt Bolt",
    "text": "Used it twice for two 75km rides in Denmark, including sections of single track, as well as 32km MTB ride through single track. \n\nAt first, it seemed to simple when compared to RideWithGPS. My first impression was \"this looks too basic\". Then after playing with it.. I realized its UI didn’t need a lot of fuss. It just works. \n\nPlanning a route just involves clicking waypoint/breadcrumbs along the map.\n\n The MTB area I go has some complex \"Figure 8\" that crosses back over the existing route already ridden!    I learned in these maze-like paths,  I simply needed to add more waypoints/breadcrumbs to prevent the route from recalculating to an alternate route.  Easy. \n\nFinding Komoot hard to fault as a route planner for the Elemnt Bolt.  \n\nOne feature I would like is the ability to edit a planned route or a tour (logged ride) in the same way.  For example:\n\nIn a planned route, I can edit the route, but I can’t add photos or journal the ride.  \n\nOn a tour that I have ridden, I can add photos and notes to journal my ride... but I can’t edit the route.    Of course that makes sense if you want to track your exact workout/trip. \n\nBut I like sharing routes with others.. and I don’t think they need to see that I rode 300m off route to go to the bathroom, or I decided to adventure off trail to a neighboring village which isn’t on the course.  \n\nLoving the app! Works great with the Bolt.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I tested and trusted the komoot for the first time on overnight bike tour through the Catskills and had an excellent time. \n\nPersonally, I think the interface is really easy to use and better to edit routes compared to other similar apps. Planning a trip on my computer was super easy. However, I wish I could rename and add notes to waypoints. With that said, the simplicity and ease of use comes with a drawback. The edit features for the map feel limited compared to ridewithgps. \n\nThe routing itself was really good and straightforward for the most part. Didn’t lead me down any roads that made me feel unsafe. On the other hand, I was a little bummed that it didn’t include a railtrail bike-way that ran parallel  to the car shared road it originally put us on. \n\nWasn’t until 20 miles later that I zoomed into the map and noticed the green road, indicating a bike path, that was hardly a mile further and it finished exactly where we needed to be. Would’ve preferred the extra distance for a bike trail any day. Especially if you’re using the \"touring\" feature. \n\nThere was also some really nice residential roads that added an extra 1-3 miles and some climbs but were a lot quieter and the cars didn’t drive by us at the same speed as interstate 28. \n\nReally awesome feature would be to include filters for even more route suggestions. \"Avoid highways/interstate\" or \"use residential roads when possible\" lastly, \"use trailways whenever possible\" with a \"distance increase disclaimer\". \n\nWould love to see the features grow for komoot and use it exclusively as my tour planning app. For now, I still rely on ride with gps to search for rides that locals do when traveling to a new place to make sure I don’t miss out on better roads and cool trails. I take those routes and edit the komoot suggested route accordingly.",

It\"s the only alternative to Google Maps that I actually enjoy using. \n\nPros:\n--> Road surface analysis and choices in planning route. \n--> Quick rerouting if I see an alternative way. \n--> Clean, high-quality interface to navigate. \n--> Useful cycling computer feedback and analysis. \n\nCons:\n--> Smart zoom is a little too distant on complex intersections. \n--> Current location button too small. \n--> Bicycle routing option can include some gravel roads. \n--> Road names aren\"t always included in voice navigation. \n\nSuggested improvements:\n--> Offer translate button for comments in various languages. \n--> Include zoom buttons for changing level of detail. \n--> Allow road names to be ommited from voice navigation. \n--> If user leaves route for more than 2-3 reroutings, assume they don\"t want to U-turn. \n\nOkay, keep up the good work! \n\nThank you!",

I planned a ride entirely within the free region, but navigation and mapping stopped part way through the ride - even though I was entirely inside the supposed \"free region\" - and I\"m told I need to buy a bigger region for it to work. Is it a bug? Is it bait and switch? Is someone going to give me an answer?\n\nThe app also locked up twice on a 30 mile ride and failed to record the mileage. Not cool.\n\nAlso, the map used by the app just isn\"t all that accurate with regard to bike trails around here, and rerouted me down a 4 lane state highway instead through the bike path tunnel. (I followed their instructions about updating Open StreetMap, but here\"s the thing: Open StreetMap already had that bike tunnel in the database - Komoot just doesn\"t seem to see it.)\n\nNext, the weather forecast they provide reads only in Celsius. You\"re tring to market this in the USA? We use Fahrenheit.\n\nFinally, there doesn\"t seem to be much responsiveness when probelms are reported through the website.\n\nAt $27 for an app, I expect better.",

But it does take the most direct route from my experience. And like a lot of others it does let you know when you deviate from the route. It also works great when you just hit record and ride freelance. \n\nOverall I think this is the best app though it does not have some of the collection data other apps have.",

There\"s no turn now only 250 feet which there are often multiple turns within the 250 feet. I usually try to listen to the street name but about 50% of the time the street name is either pronounced incorrectly or not pronounced at all by the voice for the directions. \n\nI wish there was a solid app for biking, but it looks like I\"ll have to invest in a gps of some sort for my riding since this app is not great and google maps doesn\"t allow custom routes on phones any more.",

Most can only navigate a route it calculates.  The mapping tool online works well and is easy to use.  Save a created route and it automatically becomes available in the mobile app.  Routes created elsewhere can be imported and edited.\n\nCons:  when importing a gpx route,  it can get altered by Komoot if the route goes someplace not on Open Street Maps, which Komoot uses.  The good news is you can edit Open Street maps yourself to correct the map.  Nitpicking:  voice navigation below a mile is given in feet instead of tenths of a mile.
