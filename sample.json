    "text": "Used it twice for two 75km rides in Denmark, including sections of single track, as well as 32km MTB ride through single track. \n\nAt first, it seemed to simple when compared to RideWithGPS. My first impression was "this looks too basic". Then after playing with it.. I realized its UI didn’t need a lot of fuss. It just works. \n\nPlanning a route just involves clicking waypoint/breadcrumbs along the map.\n\n The MTB area I go has some complex "Figure 8" that crosses back over the existing route already ridden!    I learned in these maze-like paths,  I simply needed to add more waypoints/breadcrumbs to prevent the route from recalculating to an alternate route.  Easy. \n\nFinding Komoot hard to fault as a route planner for the Elemnt Bolt.  \n\nOne feature I would like is the ability to edit a planned route or a tour (logged ride) in the same way.  For example:\n\nIn a planned route, I can edit the route, but I can’t add photos or journal the ride.  \n\nOn a tour that I have ridden, I can add photos and notes to journal my ride... but I can’t edit the route.    Of course that makes sense if you want to track your exact workout/trip. \n\nBut I like sharing routes with others.. and I don’t think they need to see that I rode 300m off route to go to the bathroom, or I decided to adventure off trail to a neighboring village which isn’t on the course.  \n\nLoving the app! Works great with the Bolt.  Highly recommended!",
